_The objective of this project was to analyze California cities contamination and determine whether the percentage of parks and green areas (relative to all venues in each city) had a relation with the air quality data. In order to perform a more complete analysis, cities were clustered according to air quality index information and the relation between percentage of parks/green areas and air pollution was studied within each cluster._
